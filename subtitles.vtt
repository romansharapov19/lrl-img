Hi, my name is Jennifer Medhurst

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.600
and I am a qualified nutritionist.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.880
I think it's really important to remember

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.560
that there is space for every single
type of food in our diet.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.040
There's no single nutrient
that's responsible for good health.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.720
There's no single nutrient
that's responsible for bad health.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.640
And labeling foods as good and bad

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.200
is really unhelpful,
psychologically speaking,

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.240
because as soon as the brain hears something's bad, it wants to eat it.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.400
It's much more helpful to think of foods

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.600
in terms of their nutritional value
and quality.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.840
And then beyond that, once you're hitting
all your nutritional markers,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.880
feel free to enjoy whatever you like.
